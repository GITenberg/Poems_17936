<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEY stream across the fading western sky<br /></span>
<span class="i2a">A sable cloud, far o'er the lonely leas;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now parting into scattered companies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now closing up the broken ranks, still high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And higher yet they mount, while, carelessly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trail slow behind, athwart the moving trees<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lingering few, 'round whom the evening breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plays with sad whispered murmurs as they fly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A lonely figure, ghostly in the dim<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And darkening twilight, lingers in the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of bending willows: "Surely God has laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His curse on me," he moans, "my strength of limb<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And old heart-courage fail me, and I flee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bowed with fell terror at this augury."<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT of our life when this frail flesh lies low<br /></span>
<span class="i2a">A withered clod, and the free soul has burst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the world-fetters? Not of souls accursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cherished lusts that mar them, those who sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evil and reap the harvest, and who bow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At Mammon's golden shrine, but those who thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Truth, and see not,&mdash;spirits deep immersed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In doubt and trouble,&mdash;hearts that fain would know?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The soul is satisfied. The spirit trained<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the divine, because the beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with the body gone, free and unstained,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Doubts swept away like clouds of scattering wool<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before a blast,&mdash;e'er Heaven's pure paths are trod<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is perfected to understand its God.<br /></span>

<span class="i2a">Where the glow rests, and the warm sunlight plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where earth is gladdened by the cordial rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blossoms answering, where the calm lagoon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives back the brightness of the heart of June,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he should say: "There is no sun"&mdash;the day's<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair shew still round him,&mdash;should we lose the blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warmth, and weep that day has gone so soon?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, there would be one word, one only thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The man is blind!" and throbs of pitying scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Would rouse the heart, and stir the wondering mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We <i>feel</i>, and <i>see</i>, and therefore <i>know</i>,&mdash;the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blush of youth ne'er left us till it brought<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Promise of full-grown day. "The man is blind!"<br /></span>

<span class="i2a">These skies shewed blue against the dusky trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The leaves' soft murmur in the evening breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was music, and the waves danced in the bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then was my heart, as ever, far away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With you,&mdash;and I could see you as one sees<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mirrored face,&mdash;and happiness and ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hope were mine, in spite of long delay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After these months of waiting, this is all!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hope, dead, lies coffined, shrouded in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With all the blessings of the outer air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot, 'neath the black covering of a pall.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only the darkening of the woodland ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A heart's low moaning over wasted days.<br /></span>

<span class="i2a">Could picture it in wildest dreaming, when<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For long, long hours I lay in flowery glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wooded copse, and tried in vain to tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glamour from my eyes, and face the glare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tumult of the busy world of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I staked my all, and won! and ne'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can my blest spirit know a heart's despair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;why should it be that now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When all my heart has longed for is at last<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Within my grasp, and I should be at rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ghostly Something rising in the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of Love's own fire, an uninvited guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Taunts me with just one memory of the past!<br /></span>

<span class="i2a">Flashed into crimson with the sunrise charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So all my love, aroused to vague alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed into fire and burned with eager blaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw thee not as suppliant, with still gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of pleading, but as victor,&mdash;and thine arm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gathered me fast into embraces warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was taught the light of Love's dear ways.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This day of triumph is no longer thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh conqueror, in calm exclusive power.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As evermore, through storm, and shade, and shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Your woe my pain, your joy my ecstasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We breathe together,&mdash;so this blessed hour<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of self-surrender makes my jubilee!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Even the remembrance of that parting kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that some day it would come to this<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In spite of all our sworn fidelity,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I must banish even memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sorrowing, learn to say, nor say amiss<br /></span>
<span class="i8">I will forget.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I register this vow, and am content<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That it be so. Ah me!&mdash;yet, if the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut on our heaven might be asunder rent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even now, and I could see the way we went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I might retract my vow, and say no more<br /></span>

<span class="i2a">The sun's strong wooing glow hath patiently<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Drawn the hard frost, and left it passive, free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give forth all its sweets untiringly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not the day rise fair for thee and me,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">When summer comes?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Their love-days pass, and void each sunny hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet may we smile, e'en when fate's storm-clouds lower,<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
